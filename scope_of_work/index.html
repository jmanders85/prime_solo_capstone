      <h3>Data Sources</h3>
      <p>
        Data will be entered by users of the app as they record their various sessions of sheepshead.  Although the data will be locally entered, it will be made available to the public via an API.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application will have the ability to 'read' Sheepshead data entered by score.  The users will enter data in tabular format and the application will convert each row into a 'narrative' of what occured during the play of the hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application will also make use of the Gravatar API to display a user's icon.
      </p>
      <h3>Design</h3>
      <h4>Frontend Framework</h4>
      <p>
        The application will be designed with custom css using Sass.
      </p>
      <h4>Color Palette</h4>
      <div class="color primary-color"></div>
      <div class="color white"></div>

      </p>
      <hr />
      <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
      <h3>Front End</h3>
      <p>
        The application will make extensive use of AngularJS for AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.  The styling will be created using Sass.
      </p>
      <h3>Server</h3>
      <p>
        The application will run on a Node.js server utilizing Express as the application framework.  The application will also use Passportjs for authentication.
      </p>
      <h3>Database</h3>
      <p>
        All data will be stored in a SQL database using PostgreSQL.
      </p>
